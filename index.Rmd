<br>
I am a wildlife biologist broadly interested in population and community ecology, theoretical and applied modeling, and behavioral ecology. More specifically, I am interested in better understanding how climate and other anthropogenic changes impact species interactions and behavior at the intersection of both applied and theoretical ecology.

I have about 10 years of research experience on a variety of taxa and systems, including planning and implementing a multi-year, collaborative research project assessing the impacts of climate and landcover changes on at-risk wildlife in Alaska. I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow with [Black Rock Forest](https://www.blackrockforest.org/) and the [Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory](https://lamont.columbia.edu/), where I am building on existing research efforts to understand mammal composition and landscape use in the Hudson Valley.
