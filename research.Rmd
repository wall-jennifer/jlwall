### Mammal connectivity in the Hudson Highlands

This research is part of the [Hudson Highlands Wildlife Connectivity Project](https://blackrockforest.org/wildlife-connectivity) out of Black Rock Forest, which aims to quantitatively assess barriers to the free movements of native carnivores and to identify mitigation strategies to reduce these barriers or facilitate the continued movements necessary to sustain landscape resiliency. As part of this work, I am assessing wildlife space use and functional landscape connectivity.

### Modeling deer abundance

Accurately modeling wildlife populations is crucial for effective management. This is particularly true for white-tailed deer (*Odocoileus virginianus*) populations in the Northeastern United States, where deer are both culturally and historically significant, but often overabundant and damaging to forest health. As climate changes make traditional surveys increasingly challenging and less reliable, we will need to find alternative approaches for monitoring populations. Together with Dr. Scott LaPoint and John Brady, I am working to compare various techniques for measuring deer populations (winter snow tracking, spring pellet counts, and baited and unbaited camera trap surveys) within [Black Rock Forest](www.blackrockforest.org). 

We presented this work at Black Rock Forest's biennial Hudson Highlands Symposium. See a copy of the [2025 abstracts presented here](https://www.blackrockforest.org/past-research-symposiu-presentations).

### Climate change threats to alpine wildlife

Climate change is amplified is polar regions and could have considerable consequences for biodiversity. Boreal regions have warmed more than double the global average and are experiencing increasing precipitation, thawing permafrost, shrinking snow seasons, and increasing shrub and tree encroachment. By quantifying the spatiotemporal factors influencing the abundance, distribution, and behavior of key species (namely, Arctic ground squirrels, collared pika, and hoary marmots), we can continue to tease apart complex species-climate relationships to assess species vulnerability.
